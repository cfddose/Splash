In the meantime, here are the steps to run the software:

Step 1: 
=======
Download the pre-installation script

Step 2: 
=======
Make the script executable

Before running the script, you need to make it executable. Open a terminal in the directory where pre-installation.sh is located and run the following command: 
>> chmod +x pre-installation.sh

Step 3:

Run the pre-installation script

Now, you can run the script to install all necessary dependencies. Execute the following command in the terminal:
>> ./pre-installation.sh

Enter your password if prompted to allow the installation of packages.

Enjoy SplashFOAM and thank me later ;)
