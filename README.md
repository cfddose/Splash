In the meantime, here are the steps to run the software: 

Before you begin using Splash, it's important to ensure that all necessary dependencies and packages are installed on your system. You are provided with a "pre-installation.py" script, to automate this process.

Step 1: 
=======
Download the pre-installation script

Step 2: 
=======
Make the script executable

Before running the script, you need to make it executable. Open a terminal in the directory where pre-installation.sh is located and run the following command: 
>> chmod +x pre-installation.py

Step 3:
=======
Run the pre-installation script

Now, you can run the script to install all necessary dependencies. Execute the following command in the terminal:
>> ./pre-installation

Enter your password if prompted to allow the installation of packages.

Step 4:
======= 
Enjoy SplashFOAM and thank me later ;)
